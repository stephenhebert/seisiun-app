  </a></p>
  <p></p>
  <p><em>In Short: We only process your personal information when we believe it is
      necessary and we have a valid legal reason (i.e., legal basis) to do so under applicable law, like with your
      consent, to comply with laws, to provide you with services to enter into or fulfill our contractual obligations,

      legal bases to process your personal information:</span></p>
  <ul>
    <li><span>Consent. We may process your information if you have given us
        permission (i.e., consent) to use your personal information for a specific purpose. You can withdraw your

  </ul>
  <p></p>
  <p><span>If you are located in Canada, this section applies to you.</span></p>
  <p></p>
  <p><span>We may process your information if you have given us specific permission (i.e., express
      consent) to use your personal information for a specific purpose, or in situations where your permission can be
      inferred (i.e., implied consent). You can </span><span><a href="#review">withdraw
        your consent</a></span><span>&nbsp;at any time.</span></p>
  <p></p>
  <p><span>In some exceptional cases, we may be legally permitted under applicable law to
      process your information without your consent, including, for example:</span></p>
  <ul>
    <li><span>If collection is clearly in the interests of an individual and
        consent cannot be obtained in a timely way</span></li>
  </ul>
  <ul>
    <li><span>For investigations and fraud detection and prevention</span></li>
  </ul>
  <ul>
    <li><span>For business transactions provided certain conditions are met</span>
    </li>
  </ul>
  <ul>
    <li><span>If it is contained in a witness statement and the collection is
        necessary to assess, process, or settle an insurance claim</span></li>
  </ul>
  <ul>
    <li><span>For identifying injured, ill, or deceased persons and communicating

  <ul>
    <li><span>If it is reasonable to expect collection and use with consent would

  <p></p>
  <p><em>In Short: If you choose to register or log in to our Services using a social

  <p></p>
  <p><span>Our Services offer you the ability to register and log in using your third-party
      social media account details (like your Facebook or Twitter logins). Where you choose to do this, we will receive
      certain profile information about you from your social media provider. The profile information we receive may vary
      depending on the social media provider concerned, but will often include your name, email address, friends list,
      and profile picture, as well as other information you choose to make public on such a social media
      platform.</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span>If you log in using Facebook, we may also request
      access to other permissions related to your account, such as your friends, check-ins, and likes, and you may
      choose to grant or deny us access to each individual permission.</span></p>
  <p></p>
  <p><span>We will use the information we receive only for the purposes that are described in this
      privacy notice or that are otherwise made clear to you on the relevant Services. Please note that we do not
      control, and are not responsible for, other uses of your personal information by your third-party social media
      provider. We recommend that you review their privacy notice to understand how they collect, use, and share your
      personal information, and how you can set your privacy preferences on their sites and apps.</span></p>

  <p></p>
  <p><em>In Short: We keep your information for as long as necessary to fulfill the

  <p></p>
  <p><span>We will only keep your personal information for as long as it is necessary for the
      purposes set out in this privacy notice, unless a longer retention period is required or permitted by law (such as
      tax, accounting, or other legal requirements). No purpose in this notice will require us keeping your personal
      information for longer than the period of time in which users have an account with us.</span></p>
  <p></p>
  <p><span>When we have no ongoing legitimate business need to process your personal information,
      we will either delete or anonymize such information, or, if this is not possible (for example, because your
      personal information has been stored in backup archives), then we will securely store your personal information
      and isolate it from any further processing until deletion is possible.</span></p>

      other unauthorized third parties will not be able to defeat our security and improperly collect, access, steal, or
      modify your information. Although we will do our best to protect your personal information, transmission of

      secure environment.</span></p>

  <p><strong>Verification process</strong></p>
  <p></p>
  <p><span>Upon receiving your request, we will need to verify your identity to determine you are
      the same person about whom we have the information in our system. These verification efforts require us to ask you
      to provide information so that we can match it with information you have previously provided us. For instance,
      depending on the type of request you submit, we may ask you to provide certain information so that we can match
      the information you provide with the information we already have on file, or we may contact you through a
      communication method (e.g., phone or email) that you have previously provided to us. We may also use other
      verification methods as the circumstances dictate.</span></p>
  <p></p>
  <p><span>We will only use personal information provided in your request to verify your identity
      or authority to make the request. To the extent possible, we will avoid requesting additional information from you
      for the purposes of verification. However, if we cannot verify your identity from the information already
      maintained by us, we may request that you provide additional information for the purposes of verifying your
      identity and for security or fraud-prevention purposes. We will delete such additionally provided information as
      soon as we finish verifying you.</span></p>

  </ul>
  <ul>
    <li><span>You can designate an authorized agent to make a request under the CCPA
        on your behalf. We may deny a request from an authorized agent that does not submit proof that they have been
        validly authorized to act on your behalf in accordance with the CCPA.</span></li>
  </ul>
  <ul>
    <li><span>You may request to opt out from future selling or sharing of your
        personal information to third parties. Upon receiving an opt-out request, we will act upon the request as soon
